5. **Implement dynamic pricing** algorithms
6. **Add category/tag filtering** for events
7. **Create mobile PWA** for ticket viewing

---

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing
1. **Connect Wallet** to Base Sepolia testnet
2. **Create Test Event** with future date
3. **Purchase Ticket** using testnet BASE
4. **List on Resale** at different price
5. **Cancel Event** (if you created it)
6. **Claim Refund** on canceled event
7. **Verify Ticket** using QR code

### Automated Testing
```bash
cd smcontract
npm install
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
```

## Known Limitations

1. **QR Scanning:** Frontend uses placeholder - needs jsQR library integration
2. **Stablecoin Contract:** Needs deployment and frontend integration
3. **Email Notifications:** Not implemented (Phase 2)
4. **Multi-ticket Purchase:** Not supported (one at a time)
5. **Auction/Dynamic Pricing:** Not implemented (Phase 2)
